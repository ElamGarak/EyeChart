### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#117](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin-ui/pull/117) fixes the
  about screen to no longer use a hard-coded version. Instead, it now attempts

  API is not pressent, or errors in some way, the string `@dev` is now used for
  the version.

## 1.3.2 - 2016-08-09

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#116](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin-ui/pull/116) ensures
  that the short service name, and not the full controller service name, is
  displayed on service pages.
- [#116](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin-ui/pull/116) fixes
  issues with updating the sidebar after adding a new service; previously, the
  number and type of entries was correct, but no service names were displayed
  after update; they are now displayed correctly.
- [#116](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin-ui/pull/116) fixes
  issues with updating the sidebar after removing a service; previously, the
  last service listed of the given type was removed regardless of the service
  removed; now the correct service is removed from the listing.

## 1.3.1 - 2016-08-06

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#114](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin-ui/pull/114) fixes how
  the UI generates URIs to the various service endpoints (REST and RPC services,
  their input filters, their authorization rules, and their documentation) to
  ensure they work with the latest admin changes. In particular, prior to this
  patch, the service names were receiving both a duplicate prefix and suffix
  that caused the URLs to be invalid.

## 1.3.0 - 2016-07-27

### Added

- [#113](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin-ui/pull/113) updates ZF
  component dependencies to versions that are forwards compatible with other ZF
  version 3 releases.
- [#107](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin-ui/pull/107) adds a
  "Field type" input to new/edit field entries; this information can now be used
  by documentation systems (e.g., Swagger) to report field types.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- [#113](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin-ui/pull/113) removes
  support for PHP 5.5.
- [#113](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin-ui/pull/113) removes
  the dependency on rwoverdijk/assetmanager, adding suggestions for:
  - rwoverdijk/assetmanager at `^1.7` (unreleased at this time)
  - zfcampus/zf-asset-manager at `^1.0`

### Fixed

- [#93](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin-ui/pull/93) updates how
  controller names are sent to the admin API, providing the fully qualified
  class name. This update allows the UI to properly work with modules that use a
  PSR-4 directory structure.
- [#97](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin-ui/pull/97) updates all
  API calls that pass the module name to normalize the module name using
  `encodeURIComponent()`; this allows using sub-namespaces in the backend code.

## 1.2.4 - 2016-07-27

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#54](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin-ui/pull/54) fixes display
  of field names generated from Doctrine entities, and also updates it to allow
  display and usage of underscore-separated names.
- [#85](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin-ui/pull/85) adds
  additional information to error messages when unable to create a new service
  for reasons other than conflicts.
- [#91](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin-ui/pull/91) fixes the
  templates for adding and editing validators and filters with boolean switches
  such that they now work properly.
- [#99](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin-ui/pull/99) updates the
  template to make the copyright date in the footer dynamic.
