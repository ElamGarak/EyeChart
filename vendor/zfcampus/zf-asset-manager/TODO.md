# TODO

The following are ideas for future iterations of the plugin.

- [ ] Allow configuration via the package's `composer.json`. e.g.:
  
  ```json
  "extra": {
      "asset-paths": [
          "asset/"
      ]
  }
  ```

- [ ] Potentially allow discovery of a `ConfigProvider` class, and pulling asset
  configuration via that.
