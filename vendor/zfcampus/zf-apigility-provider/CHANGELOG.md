### Added

- [#9](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-provider/pull/9) adds support
  for PHP 7.

### Deprecated

- [#9](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-provider/pull/9) deprecates the
  `Module` class. You do not need to register the package as a ZF module at this
  time, and doing so adds to performance overhead.
