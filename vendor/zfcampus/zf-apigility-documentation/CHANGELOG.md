## 1.2.0 - 2016-07-14

### Added

- [#43](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation/pull/43) adds
  support for v3 releases of Zend Framework components, while retaining support
  for v2 releases.
- [#43](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation/pull/43) extracts
  the `ApiFactory` factory inlined in the `Module` class to a first-class
  factory, `ZF\Apigility\Documentation\Factory\ApiFactoryFactory`.
- [#19](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation/pull/19) adds
  support for displaying documentation of APIs with nested namespaces (e.g.,
  `Company\ApiName` vs just `ApiName`). Such services are now denoted with
  dot-notation: `Company.ApiName`.
- [#35](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation/pull/35) adds
  a new view helper, `agTransformDescription()`, which will transform markdown
  descriptions to HTML. This is now used by default in the supplied view
  scripts. **This means you can now use markdown in your API descriptions!**
- [#38](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation/pull/38) updates
  the `Field` class to allow setting the field type, and updates the operation
  view script to now display field types for given operations.

### Deprecated

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#39](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation/pull/39) updates
  the component to properly display information about zend-inputfilter
  Collections when displaying operation validation information.
- [#40](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation/pull/40) updates
  the Operations view script to:
  - display HTTP method-specific fields first, if present.
  - display general fields only if they exist (the fix prevents an empty row
    displaying).
  - insert a closing `</span>` tag within the table data cell containing the
    required flag.
- [#41](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation/pull/41) updates
  the `ApiFactory` to ensure that if an entity has no collection associated with
  it, documentation will not attempt to retrieve the fields.
